# pandas-challenge
#Background
In this challenge we are tasked to use pandas dataframe to analyze the performance of 15 schools and 39,170 students. This analysis will help school officals determine the needs of their schools and where budget should be allocated to work on these needs. This challenge used 2 different datasets (Schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv). These csv were imported and merged to be displayed and used as a pandas dataframe. 

#Challenges
I found challenges when working on School Summary. My issues came from using undefined names and extra strings. I will continue to work towards fixing these issues and complete the challenge to make a well proven nalysis of the data.
